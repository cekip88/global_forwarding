						h3.comparison_subtitle What is Considered Truckload Freight?
						p.comparison_text
							| Truckload freight, or FTL freight, is a mode of transportation that involves
							| using a truck to transport a substantial amount of goods from one location to
							| another. In truckload shipping, the&nbsp;
							a.comparison_link entire truck
							| &nbsp;is dedicated to carrying a single shipment, typically belonging to a single
							| customer or consignor.
						p.comparison_text
							| Truckload freight is utilized when the size or weight of the shipment exceeds
							| the capacity or requirements of other transportation modes, such as LTL carriers
							| or parcel carriers. It is often more cost-effective for large or bulk shipments,
							| as the cost is typically based on the distance traveled and the space occupied
							| by the cargo within the truck.
						p.comparison_text
							| This mode of transportation offers several advantages. It provides faster transit
							| times than LTL shipping since the truck travels directly from the origin to the
							| destination without multiple stops. Additionally, truckload freight offers greater
							| flexibility in pickup and delivery times, as the truck can be scheduled according
							| to the customer’s specific requirements.
						p.comparison_text
							| Truckload freight is suitable for various goods, including raw materials,
							| finished products, and industrial equipment. It can be used for domestic and
							| international shipping, offering businesses and individuals a reliable and
							| efficient option for transporting large goods.
					.comparison_block
						h3.comparison_title Truckload Transportation Service
						p.comparison_text
							| Truckload freight shipping involves the transportation of a single freight shipment
							| from one location to another using one truck. This freight service is often the
							| most cost-effective since only one shipment is moved at a time, unlike multiple
							| loads on different trucks. It also allows for faster transit times, as fewer stops
							| are required, and a single route can be planned.
						p.comparison_text
							| One of the most significant differences between LTL and FTL shipments is dependable
							| pickup and delivery times. Full truckload services offer strict pickup and delivery
							| dates for freight shipments, ensuring your load makes it from its pickup point to
							| its final destination on time. Additionally, FTL freight shipping offers more
							| safety and security than other freight options, as each piece of cargo gets its
							| dedicated truck.
						p.comparison_text
							| The reliability and security offered by TL freight make it an ideal choice for
							| companies shipping large volumes of goods during springtime. This helps to reduce
							| the risk of damage or theft, which can occur when multiple shipments are loaded
							| onto one truck. Furthermore, truckload freight makes it easier for companies to
							| track their shipments while in transit, providing visibility into the location
							| of their goods throughout the journey.
						p.comparison_text
							| For instance, manufacturers may transport parts or raw materials long distances
							| to meet production deadlines or restock their inventory after a lull caused by
							| winter weather conditions. Similarly, retailers may require additional supplies
							| for peak shopping seasons such as Easter or Mother’s Day, necessitating quick
							| delivery times and careful handling of fragile merchandise.
						p.comparison_text
							| For all these reasons, freight shipping remains an essential part of logistics
							| operations throughout the United States during springtime. It provides customers
							| with cost-efficient transportation solutions and ensures goods arrive safely at
							| their scheduled destination. Companies seeking dependable freight solutions this
							| season should consider partnering with FreightCenter when shipping FTL.

							| Full Truckload vs. Less Than Truckload Shipping: A Comparative Analysis
						p.comparison_text
							| Freight transportation plays a vital role in today’s globalized economy,
							| ensuring the efficient movement of goods from manufacturers to consumers.
							| Two commonly used methods for shipping goods are FTL and LTL shipping.
							| FTL and LTL have distinct advantages and disadvantages, and understanding
							| their differences is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions about
							| their shipping needs. Let’s compare FTL and LTL shipping, highlighting their
							| key features, benefits, and considerations.
					.comparison_block
						h3.comparison_subtitle Definition and Scope:
						p.comparison_text
							strong FTL:
							| &nbsp;Full Truckload shipping refers to transporting goods that occupy an entire
							| trailer. It typically involves larger shipments or items that require
							| dedicated space.
						p.comparison_text
							strong LTL:
							| &nbsp;Less Than Truckload shipping involves shipments that do not require a full
							| trailer. Multiple shipments from different shippers are consolidated into a
							| single truck, sharing space and costs.
						h3.comparison_subtitle Cost Considerations:
						.comparison_inner
							p.comparison_text
								strong.red FTL:
								| &nbsp;FTL shipments are typically priced based on the space the goods occupy.
								| While FTL may be more expensive for smaller loads, it offers cost advantages
								| for more extensive and bulkier shipments due to economies of scale.
							p.comparison_text
								strong.green LTL:
								| &nbsp;LTL shipments are priced based on weight, dimensions, and distance
								| traveled. LTL shipping can be cost-effective for smaller loads, as the
								| cost is shared among multiple shippers.
						h3.comparison_subtitle Transit Time and Speed:
						.comparison_inner
							p.comparison_text
								strong.green FTL:
								| &nbsp;With FTL shipping, there is usually a direct route from the pickup location
								| to the destination, resulting in shorter transit times and faster delivery.
							p.comparison_text
								strong.red LTL:
								| &nbsp;LTL: LTL shipments involve multiple stops for pickups and drop-offs,
								| which can increase transit times. However, advancements in LTL logistics have
								| improved speed and efficiency in recent years.
						h3.comparison_subtitle Flexibility and Capacity:
						.comparison_inner
							p.comparison_text
								strong.green FTL:
								| &nbsp;FTL shipping offers greater flexibility in scheduling and
								| pickup/delivery times. It is ideal for businesses with time-sensitive or
								| high-volume shipments that require dedicated space and immediate delivery.
							p.comparison_text
								strong.red LTL:
								| &nbsp;LTL shipping provides flexibility for businesses with smaller shipments,
								| allowing them to share truck space with other shippers. However, it may have
								| limitations in terms of specific delivery schedules.
						h3.comparison_subtitle Risk of Damage and Loss:
						.comparison_inner
							p.comparison_text
								strong.green FTL:
								| &nbsp;FTL shipping minimizes the risk of damage or loss as the goods
								| are not handled or transferred during transit. The shipment remains secure
								| and intact throughout the journey.
							p.comparison_text
								strong.red LTL:
								| &nbsp;LTL shipments are more susceptible to handling and transfers during
								| consolidation and deconsolidation processes, which may increase the risk of
								| damage or loss.
						h3.comparison_subtitle Documentation and Tracking:
						.comparison_inner
							p.comparison_text
								strong.green FTL:
								| &nbsp;FTL shipping involves more detailed documentation and tracking processes
								| since the truckload belongs to a single shipper. The shipper has greater
								| control and visibility over their shipment.
							p.comparison_text
								strong.red LTL:
								| &nbsp;LTL shipments require more complex documentation and tracking, as
								| multiple shippers are involved. However, modern technology has improved LTL
								| tracking capabilities, providing increased visibility.
						p.comparison_text
							| In summary, the choice between FTL and LTL shipping depends on various factors,
							| including shipment size, volume, urgency, budget, and specific requirements.
							| FTL shipping offers advantages such as faster transit times, dedicated space,
							| and reduced risk of damage, making it suitable for large shipments or
							| time-sensitive deliveries. On the other hand, LTL shipping provides cost savings
							| for smaller loads, flexibility in sharing truck space, and advancements in speed
							| and efficiency. Businesses should carefully evaluate their shipping needs and
							| consider these factors to determine the most appropriate method for their
							| requirements.
					.comparison_block.comparison_gallery
						h3.comparison_subtitle Choosing The Right Type Of Truckload Equipment
						p.comparison_text
							| Truckload freight commodities are large shipments of goods that fill an entire
							| trailer. A truckload shipment can refer to a full trailer of any size, ranging
							| from a standard dry van to a refrigerated truck or flatbed with specialized
							| materials. The size and type of the freight determine how much the trailer
							| can carry, but typically loads range between 10,000-30,000 lbs.
						p.comparison_text
							| Unlike LTL shipping, where multiple small shipments share space on one truck,
							| truckload shipments are exclusive to the customer who ordered them. Before
							| shipping your commodities, it is essential to consider what form of truckload
							| service you need and what trailer type is best for your freight shipment. At
							| FreightCenter, we can help determine what trailer type best fits your
							| shipment’s needs.
						p.comparison_text
							| Determining whether your shipment needs a semi-trailer, drop deck, or flatbed
							| will also help determine the best way to package your shipment. Here are a
							| few types of truckload services that FreightCenter carriers regularly offer:
					.comparison_block
						h3.comparison_title Types of Truckload Services Offered
						p.comparison_text
							| FreightCenter offers a variety of truckload services to meet different shipping
							| needs. These services include full truckload (FTL), less-than-truckload (LTL),
							| refrigerated, flatbed, and expedited shipping. Each type of service is designed
							| to handle specific shipments, ensuring that goods are transported safely and
							| efficiently.
						p.comparison_text
							| Full truckload (FTL) service is ideal for large shipments that fill an entire
							| truck. This type of service is perfect for businesses that need to ship large
							| quantities of goods at once. With FTL, the whole truck is dedicated to one
							| shipment, reducing the risk of damage and ensuring faster delivery times.
							| FreightCenter’s FTL services are reliable and offer competitive pricing,
							| making them an excellent choice for oversized shipments.
						p.comparison_text
							| Partial Truckload (PTL) service is suitable for smaller shipments that do not
							| require an entire truck. This service allows multiple shippers to share the
							| same truck, making it a cost-effective option for shipping smaller goods.
							| FreightCenter’s PTL services provide flexibility and affordability, helping
							| businesses save money while ensuring their goods are delivered safely.
						p.comparison_text
							| Refrigerated truckload service is essential for shipping perishable goods
							| that must be kept at a specific temperature. This service is commonly used
							| for transporting food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, and other

						h3.comparison_title Truckload Shipping Seasons: Understanding Industry Fluctuations
						p.comparison_text
							| The transportation and logistics industry experiences regular fluctuations
							| throughout the year, driven by truckload shipping seasons. These seasonal
							| variations directly impact capacity and rates, influencing the available options
							| for shippers. By understanding these shipping seasons, businesses can optimize
							| their supply chains and effectively plan for increased demand and tighter
							| capacity periods.
						h3.comparison_subtitle Slow Season – January to March:
						p.comparison_text
							| Following the holiday rush, the transportation and logistics industry enters a
							| slower shipping season from January to March. While shipping volumes decreased
							| during this period, it is important to note that the sector remains active.
							| Essential items such as medication, food, face masks, and hand sanitizers are
							| in high demand. Additionally, the transportation of COVID-19 vaccines requires
							| refrigerated trucks for nationwide distribution. Moreover, consumers often
							| return items they receive over the holidays, resulting in shipping them back
							| to the original seller. During this slower season, truckload rates favor
							| shippers due to lower shipping volumes. Carriers are more willing to take
							| on work, making rates more favorable for shippers. By March, shipping volumes
							| begin to increase as spring and summer approach.
						h3.comparison_subtitle Increased Volume Season – April to July:
						p.comparison_text
							| The arrival of spring increases shipping volumes, making it easier for drivers
							| to find work compared to the slower months. This period marks a truckload shipping
							| season where carrier availability decreases, leading to tighter rates. The
							| produce harvest season also contributes to the rise in shipment volumes,
							| particularly for truckload shippers transporting food products or produce. For
							| instance, produce shipments often require temperature-controlled equipment to
							| minimize spoilage or damage, especially during the hot summer.
						h3.comparison_subtitle Peak Shipping Season – August to October:
						p.comparison_text
							| From August to October, the industry experiences the peak shipping season,
							| which coincides with the continued produce season. Retailers and e-commerce stores
							| witness a surge in product shipments due to increased online consumer purchases.
							|This heightened demand for shipping results in further tightening of capacity,
							| necessitating more trucks than usual to meet the needs of shippers.
						h3.comparison_subtitle Holiday Shipping Season – November and December:
						p.comparison_text
							| November and December represent the busiest months for the transportation and
							| logistics industry. Consumers take advantage of major sales events such as Black
							| Friday, Cyber Monday, and Small Business Saturday in November, with some retailers
							| extending Black Friday sales throughout the month. Consumers make last-
							| minute purchases in December before shipping gifts to friends and family. Retailers
							| ship more significant quantities of goods during this period, further increasing
							| shipping volumes. However, as mid-December approaches and most consumers finish
							| holiday shopping, the industry slows down again.
						p.comparison_text
							| Knowing the shipping seasons is crucial for businesses aiming to optimize their
							| shipping strategies. By understanding the fluctuations in demand and capacity,
							| companies can effectively plan for each season and ensure a smooth and efficient
							| transportation process.

						h3.tl-rates_title What Is Truckload Freight?
						p.tl-rates_text
							| Truckload freight, or full truckload (FTL) shipping, refers to transporting goods
							| that fill an entire truck. This type of freight service is used when a shipment
							| is large enough to occupy the full capacity of a truck, typically ranging from
							| 10,000 to 45,000 pounds. Companies often choose truckload freight for shipping
							| large quantities of goods to ensure that their items are transported directly
							| from the pickup location to the destination without additional stops or transfers.
							| This direct route minimizes the risk of damage and ensures faster delivery times.
						p.tl-rates_text
							| One of the main advantages of truckload freight is efficiency. The process is
							| streamlined since the truck is fully loaded with goods from a single shipper.
							| There is no need to stop and load or unload other shipments along the way,
							| which can significantly reduce transit time. This makes truckload freight an
							| excellent option for businesses needing to market their products quickly or
							| meet tight delivery schedules.
						p.tl-rates_text
							| Another benefit of truckload freight is the reduced risk of damage. Because the
							| goods remain in the same truck throughout the journey, there is less handling
							| involved compared to other shipping methods. Less handling means fewer
							| opportunities for items to be damaged. This is especially important for
							| fragile or high-value goods requiring extra transportation care. By choosing
							| truckload freight, shippers can have greater peace of mind knowing their goods
							| are handled minimally and carefully.
						p.tl-rates_text
							| Truckload freight also offers more flexibility in terms of load types and sizes.
							| Trucks can accommodate various goods, including oversized items, machinery, and
							| large pallets. Additionally, truckload carriers often provide specialized
							| equipment, such as refrigerated trailers for perishable goods or flatbed trucks
							| for oversized loads. This versatility allows shippers to transport diverse
							| products using the most suitable truck and equipment for their specific needs.
						p.tl-rates_text
							| Finally, truckload freight can be cost-effective for larger shipments. While
							| the upfront cost of booking an entire truck may be higher than other shipping
							| methods, the efficiency and reduced risk of damage can lead to overall
							| savings. Businesses can avoid the hidden costs of delays, damages, and
							| additional handling fees. Furthermore, many truckload carriers offer
							| competitive rates and discounts for regular shippers, making it a financially
							| viable option for businesses with consistent large-scale shipping needs.
						p.tl-rates_text
							| In conclusion, truckload freight is an ideal solution for transporting large
							| quantities of goods efficiently and safely. Its direct routes, reduced handling,
							| flexibility, and potential cost savings provide significant advantages for
							| businesses looking to move their products quickly and reliably. Understanding
							| the specifics of truckload freight helps companies make informed decisions
							| about their shipping strategies, ensuring they choose the best method for
							| their logistical needs.
